# Aditya Deshpande's Master's Dissertation
This repository contains the LaTeX source and associated assets for my Master's Dissertation, 
which I wrote during my final year at Imperial College London in the academic year 2021-2022.
You are free to compile the LaTeX source yourself, or you can read the compiled PDF
[here](https://github.com/adidesh20/Masters-Dissertation/blob/master/dissertation.pdf).

## What is the dissertation about?
The dissertation itself describes the research, activities, and implementation that I carried out
during my Final Year Project (FYP) for my MEng in Computer Engineering ([Electronic and Information 
Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/electronic-information-meng/) 
was the *official* degree title).
My project extended [Issie](https://github.com/tomcl/issie), an education-focused hardware design application built
in-house at Imperial College. I improved logic visualisation and analysis in the application by adding interactive
schematic-derived truth tables. These can be manipulated, reduced, and filtered to describe combinational logic 
relationships in numeric and algebraic forms. 
 * The logic reduction algorithm differs significantly from those commonly used in industry such as *Espresso*; 
those aim to reduce the complexity of the hardware while mine aims to clarify the function of the combinational logic. 
 * Displaying algebraic relationships between inputs and outputs in combinational logic involved designing a new
context-sensitive formal language which combines Boolean algebra, regular arithmetic, and other operations.

The **Introduction** and **Background** sections of the dissertation provide a comprehensive explanation
of the aims and motivations of the project, while **Analysis and Design** and **Implementation** describe the
how, why, and what of my work.

## Where can I see/try out the completed project?
My work on Issie has been merged upstream, and you can try it out by downloading the latest version from the
[releases](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/releases) page on the Issie GitHub repository. If you want to specifically
view the work done during the FYP, see [this branch](https://github.com/adidesh20/issie/tree/pure-fyp) on my fork of Issie.

## How did you do?
I received glowing feedback from my supervisor and markers following my presentation, and received a very high mark of 87%.
I was also awared the **Electrical & Electronic Engineering Student Centenary Prize** for this Final Year Project.
I am pleased to say I graduated with First Class Honours from Imperial in 2022.

## Licenses and Copyright
Issie is under GPL 3.0, so my contributions to that project of course fall under that license. However, my dissertation 
is **not under a free license** and is under my own copyright. You are, of course, free to read it!
