\chapter{Abstract}
Issie (Interactive Schematic Simulator with Integrated Editor) is an education-focused digital electronics design platform used by students at Imperial College London, featuring an intuitive user-friendly UI and capable logic simulator. One of the many challenges a student may face when learning to design digital logic is conceptualising relationships between inputs and outputs in combinational logic, and how they relate to design specifications. This project extends the existing Issie application, exploring novel ways to communicate these logic relationships to the user. This is primarily achieved through the implementation of interactive automatic schematic-derived truth tables, which can be manipulated, reduced, and filtered to describe combinational logic relationships in numeric and algebraic forms. This involved the definition of an alternative formal language to Boolean algebra for representing combinational logic. 

Additionally, this project has also made changes to the top-level UI of the application to make the user experience more consistent and conducive to learning.
The extended functionality delivered by the project is effective and performant, and has been tested on circuits designed by EE students at Imperial College London. Large digital logic circuits, such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit of an 8-bit ARM CPU, can be condensed from a schematic containing billions of possible input combinations to a short algebraic truth table describing a few dozen cases.
